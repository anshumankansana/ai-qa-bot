üéØ Assignment Overview
The Challenge:
Build a tiny AI-powered app as an internship assignment to demonstrate motivation, resourcefulness, and creativity.
Options Given:
1.	AI Q&A Bot (command-line app with API integration)
2.	Text Summarizer (summarize articles in 3 sentences)
3.	Personal Expense Tracker (track and summarize expenses)
My Choice:
I chose the AI Q&A Bot because it offered the most learning potential and allowed me to explore modern AI APIs.
Requirements:
‚Ä¢	Show effort and resourcefulness
‚Ä¢	Document every step (including failures)
‚Ä¢	Build something functional
‚Ä¢	Stretch goal: Add a simple UI or deploy it
My Goal:
Not just meet the requirements, but exceed them by building something I'd actually want to use.

üóìÔ∏è My 4-Day Journey
Day 1: Research & First Attempt (8 hours)
Morning: Understanding the Assignment
I spent the first few hours researching AI APIs and reading the assignment carefully. I wanted to understand:
‚Ä¢	What makes a good Q&A bot?
‚Ä¢	Which APIs are available and free?
‚Ä¢	What's the simplest way to get started?
Initial Research:
‚Ä¢	Looked at OpenAI (requires payment)
‚Ä¢	Found Hugging Face (free and open-source)
‚Ä¢	Read about various models available
First Approach: Hugging Face
I started with Hugging Face because everyone recommends it for beginners. I thought it would be straightforward.
# My first attempt
from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient

client = InferenceClient()
response = client.text_generation(
    "What is Python?",
    model="meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct"
)
The Problem:
‚ùå Model didn't exist
‚ùå Got 404 errors
‚ùå Tried 5 different models - all unavailable or loading
Models I tried:
1.	meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct - Not found
2.	microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct - Loading forever
3.	mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 - Timeout
4.	google/flan-t5-large - Service unavailable
5.	HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta - 503 error
Afternoon: Multiple Approaches
Instead of giving up, I tried different strategies:
Attempt 2: Direct API calls
import requests
# Tried making raw API calls - same issues
Attempt 3: Multiple model fallback
# Created a list of models, tried each one
# Still didn't work consistently
Attempt 4: Adding retry logic
# Added wait times and retries
# Models were genuinely unavailable, not just slow
What I Learned on Day 1:
‚Ä¢	Free inference APIs can be unreliable
‚Ä¢	Models need to "warm up" which can take 20-30 seconds
‚Ä¢	Sometimes the best solution is to try something completely different
‚Ä¢	Documentation doesn't always match reality
End of Day 1 Status:
Frustrated but determined. Decided to research alternatives overnight.
________________________________________
Day 2: The Breakthrough (10 hours)
Morning: Discovering Groq
While researching alternatives, I found Groq:
‚Ä¢	‚ö° Claims to be "fastest inference"
‚Ä¢	üÜì Free tier with generous limits
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Always-on infrastructure
‚Ä¢	üìö Clean, simple API
Decision Point:
Should I keep fighting with Hugging Face or try Groq? I decided to give Groq a shot.
Setting up Groq (30 minutes):
1.	Signed up at console.groq.com
2.	Created API key (instant, no credit card)
3.	Installed package: pip install groq
4.	Tested basic call
from groq import Groq

client = Groq(api_key="my_key")
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="llama-3.1-8b-instant",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
Result: ‚úÖ Worked instantly! Response in under 1 second!
That moment when it worked was incredible. After a full day of errors, seeing a real response felt amazing.
Mid-Morning: Building CLI Version (2 hours)
With working API, I quickly built the command-line version:
# Basic structure I created:
1. Initialize Groq client
2. Loop for user input
3. Send to API
4. Display response
5. Handle errors gracefully
Features I added to CLI:
‚Ä¢	Welcome message
‚Ä¢	Error handling
‚Ä¢	"quit" command
‚Ä¢	Conversation counter
‚Ä¢	Clean formatting
Tested with questions like:
‚Ä¢	"What is Python?"
‚Ä¢	"Explain machine learning"
‚Ä¢	"How do I learn to code?"
All worked perfectly!
Afternoon: Basic Streamlit UI (3 hours)
Time to build the web interface for the stretch goal.
First Streamlit app (1 hour):
import streamlit as st

st.title("AI Q&A Bot")
question = st.text_input("Ask anything:")
if question:
    response = get_ai_response(question)
    st.write(response)
It worked, but looked very basic - default Streamlit theme, no personality.
Adding features (2 hours):
‚Ä¢	Chat message display
‚Ä¢	Conversation history
‚Ä¢	Timestamps
‚Ä¢	Basic statistics
End of Day 2 Status:
‚úÖ Working CLI version
‚úÖ Working web version
‚úÖ Core functionality complete
‚ùì But it looked like every other Streamlit tutorial...
Evening Realization:
Every intern probably submits a basic chatbot. I needed something that would stand out. Started thinking about what features would make this special.
________________________________________
Day 3: Making It Special (12 hours)
Morning Brainstorm:
I asked myself: "What would make this impressive?"
My ideas:
‚Ä¢	Multiple chat sessions (like ChatGPT)
‚Ä¢	Private/incognito mode
‚Ä¢	Better UI design
‚Ä¢	Export functionality
‚Ä¢	More statistics
Decision: Implement multiple chats + incognito mode + UI overhaul
Morning: Implementing Multiple Chats (4 hours)
This was the hardest part technically.
The Challenge:
Streamlit reruns the entire script on every interaction. How do I maintain multiple separate conversations?
My Solution:
Use session state with a dictionary structure:
st.session_state.chats = {
    'chat_id_1': {
        'name': 'Chat 1',
        'messages': [...],
        'created': timestamp,
        'incognito': False
    }
}
Issues I faced:
1.	Chats disappearing - Fixed by proper initialization
2.	App crashing on delete - Fixed by checking chat count
3.	State getting lost - Fixed by careful state management
4.	Switching chats not working - Fixed by proper rerun logic
Debugging approach:
‚Ä¢	Added print statements (then removed them)
‚Ä¢	Drew diagrams of state structure on paper
‚Ä¢	Tested edge cases (delete, switch, create simultaneously)
‚Ä¢	Refactored code twice to make it cleaner
Afternoon: Incognito Mode (2 hours)
Why I added this:
Privacy matters. Some questions are personal. Users should have control.
Implementation:
# Toggle in sidebar
incognito = st.toggle("Incognito Mode")

# Visual indicator
if incognito:
    st.markdown("üïµÔ∏è INCOGNITO MODE ACTIVE")
Features:
‚Ä¢	Purple badge when active
‚Ä¢	Per-chat setting
‚Ä¢	Clear messaging about what it does
‚Ä¢	Visual emoji indicators
Evening: UI Overhaul (6 hours)
This took the longest but was the most rewarding.
Learning CSS (2 hours):
‚Ä¢	Watched YouTube tutorials on CSS gradients
‚Ä¢	Studied modern web apps (ChatGPT, Linear, Notion)
‚Ä¢	Experimented with color combinations
‚Ä¢	Learned about hover effects and transitions
Implementing Custom Styles (4 hours):
/* What I created */
- Gradient backgrounds (purple to dark blue)
- Smooth hover effects on buttons
- Custom input field styling
- Professional color scheme
- Rounded corners everywhere
- Shadow effects
Trial and error:
‚Ä¢	Tried 10+ different color schemes
‚Ä¢	Tested different gradient angles
‚Ä¢	Adjusted spacing and padding
‚Ä¢	Made sure text was readable
‚Ä¢	Tested hover effects
End of Day 3 Status:
‚úÖ Multiple chat sessions working
‚úÖ Incognito mode implemented
‚úÖ Beautiful custom UI
‚úÖ Way beyond assignment requirements

Day 4: Polish & Documentation (8 hours)
Morning: Final Features (3 hours)
Added:
1.	Export functionality - Download chats as JSON
2.	Chat management - Rename and organize
3.	Better statistics - Track usage
4.	Error messages - User-friendly feedback
Testing (1 hour):
‚Ä¢	Created multiple test chats
‚Ä¢	Tested all buttons and features
‚Ä¢	Checked edge cases
‚Ä¢	Fixed minor bugs
‚Ä¢	Verified on different screen sizes
Afternoon: Documentation (4 hours)

1.	README.md - Project overview and setup
2.	Code comments - Explain complex parts
3.	This journey document - The full story
4.	.env.example - Show required variables
5.	Installation guide - Step-by-step instructions
Evening: Final Review (1 hour)
Checklist:
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Code is clean and commented
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ All features work
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Documentation is complete
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Installation is simple
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ README explains everything
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Git repository is organized
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ .gitignore is proper

üòì Challenges & Solutions
Challenge 1: Hugging Face Models Not Working
Time Lost: 8 hours on Day 1
The Problem:
Every Hugging Face model I tried was either unavailable, loading, or timing out. This was incredibly frustrating because all the tutorials made it look easy.
What I tried:
1.	Different models (tried 5+)
2.	Direct API calls with requests
3.	Retry logic with delays
4.	Error handling for "model loading"
The Solution:
Switched to Groq API completely. Sometimes the best solution is to try a different approach entirely.
What I learned:
‚Ä¢	Free services can be unreliable
‚Ä¢	Don't be married to your first idea
‚Ä¢	Research alternatives when stuck
‚Ä¢	Time spent struggling taught me more than if it worked immediately
________________________________________
Challenge 2: Multiple Chat Management
Time Spent: 4 hours on Day 3
The Problem:
Streamlit reruns everything on each interaction, making state management tricky. Chats were disappearing, or the app would crash when deleting.
Specific Issues:
‚Ä¢	Creating new chat would reset existing chats
‚Ä¢	Deleting a chat would crash the app
‚Ä¢	Switching chats would lose messages
‚Ä¢	State wasn't persisting correctly
The Solution:
# Careful initialization
if 'chats' not in st.session_state:
    # Initialize properly
    
# Safe access
if chat_id in st.session_state.chats:
    # Use the chat
    
# Handle deletion
if len(chats) > 1:  # Don't delete last chat
    del st.session_state.chats[chat_id]
What I learned:
‚Ä¢	State management is harder than it looks
‚Ä¢	Drawing diagrams helps understand structure
‚Ä¢	Test edge cases thoroughly
‚Ä¢	Small bugs can cause big problems
________________________________________
Challenge 3: Making the UI Beautiful
Time Spent: 6 hours on Day 3
The Problem:
I'm not a designer. The default Streamlit look is functional but boring. I wanted something that looked professional.
My Process:
1.	Research - Looked at modern apps (2 hours)
2.	Learn - CSS tutorials and documentation (2 hours)
3.	Experiment - Tried different designs (2 hours)
What worked:
‚Ä¢	Starting with color scheme (picked red/pink gradients)
‚Ä¢	Adding gradients everywhere
‚Ä¢	Smooth transitions on hover
‚Ä¢	Consistent spacing
‚Ä¢	Professional typography
What didn't work:
‚Ä¢	First 5 color schemes looked terrible
‚Ä¢	Too many animations made it distracting
‚Ä¢	Some effects didn't work on mobile
What I learned:
‚Ä¢	Good UI takes time
‚Ä¢	Copy what works (ethically)
‚Ä¢	Less is often more
‚Ä¢	Test on different screens
‚Ä¢	User experience matters as much as functionality
________________________________________
Challenge 4: Streamlit Deployment & Secrets Management
Time Spent: 2 hours on Day 4
The Problem:
When I tried to deploy my app to Streamlit Cloud, it kept failing. The app worked perfectly locally but crashed on deployment.
The Error:
Error: GROQ_API_KEY not found
App failed to start
What was happening:
Locally, I was using a .env file to store my API key:
# This worked locally
load_dotenv()
api_key = os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY")
But Streamlit Cloud doesn't support .env files!
Why .env doesn't work on Streamlit Cloud:
‚Ä¢	.env files are in .gitignore (correctly, for security)
‚Ä¢	They never get pushed to GitHub
‚Ä¢	Streamlit Cloud can't access them
‚Ä¢	Different deployment platforms have different ways of handling secrets
My debugging process:
1.	First deploy attempt - Failed ‚ùå
2.	Checked logs - "GROQ_API_KEY not found"
3.	Realized .env isn't available
4.	Researched Streamlit secrets management
5.	Found Streamlit uses secrets.toml file
The Solution:
Streamlit Cloud uses a special secrets management system.
Step 1: Create .streamlit/secrets.toml for local testing
# .streamlit/secrets.toml
GROQ_API_KEY = "gsk_your_key_here"
Step 2: Update code to support both methods
# Updated my code to work both locally and on Streamlit Cloud
import os
import streamlit as st
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

def get_api_key():
    # Try Streamlit secrets first (for deployment)
    if hasattr(st, 'secrets') and 'GROQ_API_KEY' in st.secrets:
        return st.secrets['GROQ_API_KEY']
    # Fall back to .env file (for local development)
    return os.getenv('GROQ_API_KEY')

api_key = get_api_key()
Step 3: Configure secrets on Streamlit Cloud
1.	Went to app settings on Streamlit Cloud
2.	Found "Secrets" section
3.	Added my API key:
GROQ_API_KEY = "gsk_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
Step 4: Updated .gitignore
.env
.streamlit/secrets.toml
The Result:
‚úÖ Works locally with .env
‚úÖ Works on Streamlit Cloud with secrets
‚úÖ API key never exposed in GitHub
‚úÖ Deployment successful!
What I learned:
‚Ä¢	Different platforms handle secrets differently
‚Ä¢	Always test deployment early
‚Ä¢	Read platform-specific documentation
‚Ä¢	Security and convenience can both be achieved
‚Ä¢	.env is great for local, but not for deployment
Important lesson for future:
Never assume local development environment matches production. Test deployment early, not at the last minute!
Files I created for proper deployment:
.streamlit/secrets.toml (local testing):
# This file is gitignored
GROQ_API_KEY = "your_key_here"
Updated .gitignore:
.env
.streamlit/
*.toml
Deployment checklist I created:
‚Ä¢	[ ] Code works locally
‚Ä¢	[ ] .env in .gitignore
‚Ä¢	[ ] .streamlit/secrets.toml in .gitignore
‚Ä¢	[ ] Code supports both .env and st.secrets
‚Ä¢	[ ] Secrets added in Streamlit Cloud dashboard
‚Ä¢	[ ] Test deployment
‚Ä¢	[ ] Verify API key works in production
This challenge taught me that deployment is part of development, not an afterthought!
________________________________________
Challenge 5: Time Management
The Reality:
I had 4 days to complete this. That's not a lot of time!
My Approach:
Day 1: Research + Failed attempts (necessary!)
Day 2: Core functionality (CLI + basic web)
Day 3: Advanced features (multiple chats, UI)
Day 4: Polish, documentation, and deployment
What worked:
‚Ä¢	Starting simple (CLI first)
‚Ä¢	Building incrementally
‚Ä¢	Testing as I go
‚Ä¢	Not trying to do everything at once
‚Ä¢	Testing deployment on Day 4 (caught the secrets issue!)
What I'd improve:
‚Ä¢	Started Day 1 with more research
‚Ä¢	Could have found Groq faster
‚Ä¢	Should have sketched UI before coding
‚Ä¢	Should have tested deployment earlier (Day 3)
What I learned:
‚Ä¢	Plan but be flexible
‚Ä¢	Document as you go (not at the end)
‚Ä¢	Small wins build momentum
‚Ä¢	It's okay to pivot when something isn't working
‚Ä¢	Test deployment before the last day!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Challenge 6 Streamlit Deployment Issues & Switching to Render
Time Spent: 3 hours on Day 4
The Problem:
After updating my app and preparing for deployment on Streamlit Cloud, I kept running into the ‚ÄúGROQ_API_KEY not found‚Äù error. The app worked perfectly locally, but deployment kept failing despite following the .env approach.
What I tried:
‚Ä¢	Adding .env file (worked locally, but not in Streamlit Cloud)
‚Ä¢	Using load_dotenv() and os.getenv() in various ways
‚Ä¢	Searching forums for workarounds
‚Ä¢	Creating .streamlit/secrets.toml (still confusing at first)
The Core Issue:
‚Ä¢	Streamlit Cloud doesn‚Äôt support .env files for secrets.
‚Ä¢	Secrets need to be configured in the Streamlit dashboard.
‚Ä¢	.env files are ignored in GitHub for security, so deployment fails if the platform cannot access the key.
The Solution:
I decided to switch deployment from Streamlit Cloud to Render, which provides full Python support and better handling for environment variables.
Steps I followed on Render:
1.	Signed up at https://render.com.
2.	Prepared the project folder with app.py and requirements.txt.
3.	Uploaded the project manually (or connected GitHub repo).
4.	Set the Build Command:
pip install -r requirements.txt
5.	Set the Start Command:
streamlit run app.py --server.port $PORT --server.address 0.0.0.0
6.	Added GROQ_API_KEY as an environment variable in Render dashboard.
7.	Verified the app runs successfully with no secrets errors.
The Result:
‚úÖ Works locally and on Render deployment
‚úÖ API key is never exposed
‚úÖ Streamlit app runs without crash
‚úÖ Deployment is stable and reliable
What I Learned:
‚Ä¢	Different deployment platforms have unique requirements.
‚Ä¢	.env files are great for local development, but not for production.
‚Ä¢	Environment variables are crucial for API security.
‚Ä¢	Render provides more flexibility for Python apps than Streamlit Cloud for complex projects.
‚Ä¢	Always test deployment early, not at the last minute.

ü§ì Reflections
What Went Really Well
1. Finding Groq Early (Day 2)
If I'd spent another day on Hugging Face, I wouldn't have had time for advanced features.
2. Adding Multiple Chats
This single feature elevated the entire project. It went from "simple bot" to "actual application."
3. Focusing on UX
The 6 hours on CSS were worth it. The app looks professional, not like a tutorial project.
4. Time Management
I finished in 4 days with time to spare for documentation.
5. Documentation
Writing this README helped me understand my own project better.
What I'd Do Differently
1. Research First, Code Second
If I'd researched APIs for 2 hours on Day 1 instead of immediately coding, I might have found Groq sooner.
2. Start with Git
I didn't use Git until Day 3. Lost some early experimental code.
3. Mobile Testing
I focused on desktop. Mobile experience could be better.
4. Ask for Feedback Earlier
I worked alone until Day 4. Earlier feedback would have helped.
5. Plan UI Before Coding It
I redesigned the UI 3 times. A sketch would have saved time.
Biggest Challenge
Day 1 Hugging Face struggles.
Those 8 hours were frustrating, but they taught me:
‚Ä¢	Not everything works as advertised
‚Ä¢	Knowing when to change approaches
‚Ä¢	How to research alternatives
‚Ä¢	Dealing with technical frustration
Most Rewarding Moment
When the Groq API worked on Day 2.
After a full day of errors, seeing that first successful response was incredible. That's the moment I knew I could actually complete this.
Skills I'm Most Proud Of
1. Problem-solving - Found solutions when first approach failed
2. Persistence - Didn't give up on Day 1
3. Going beyond - Added features beyond requirements
4. UI/UX thinking - Made it look professional
5. Documentation - Thorough and honest
What This Project Taught Me

‚Ä¢	Things rarely work first try
‚Ä¢	Good UX takes time
‚Ä¢	Documentation is part of the product
‚Ä¢	Simple often beats complex
‚Ä¢	User needs drive features
About Myself:
‚Ä¢	I can learn quickly under pressure
‚Ä¢	I enjoy solving problems
‚Ä¢	I care about user experience
‚Ä¢	I don't give up easily
‚Ä¢	I can manage time effectively
About AI Development:
‚Ä¢	API reliability matters
‚Ä¢	Speed affects user experience
‚Ä¢	Context management is tricky

üéì Assignment Reflection
Did I Meet the Requirements?
Required:
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Build a simple AI-powered app
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Document every step (including failures)
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Show effort and resourcefulness
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Demonstrate creativity
Stretch Goals:
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Add a simple UI (went way beyond "simple")
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Deploy it (ready for Streamlit Cloud)
What Makes This Stand Out?
Beyond Requirements:
‚Ä¢	Not just one feature, but 10+
‚Ä¢	Not just functional, but beautiful
‚Ä¢	Not just working, but polished
‚Ä¢	Not just code, but documentation
‚Ä¢	Not just basic, but advanced
Demonstrates:
‚Ä¢	Technical ability (API integration, state management)
‚Ä¢	Problem-solving (Hugging Face ‚Üí Groq)
‚Ä¢	User empathy (multiple chats, incognito mode)
‚Ä¢	Design sense (custom UI)
‚Ä¢	Communication (this README)
Time Breakdown
Total: ~38 hours over 4 days

Day 1 (8h):  Research, failed attempts, learning
Day 2 (10h): Finding Groq, building core
Day 3 (12h): Advanced features, UI overhaul
Day 4 (8h):  Polish, testing, documentation
Was it worth it?
Absolutely. I learned more in 4 days than I have in weeks of tutorials.

Message to Evaluators
This project represents 4 intensive days of learning, problem-solving, and building. It's not perfect‚Äîno project ever is‚Äîbut it's something I'm genuinely proud of.
The challenges I faced (especially Day 1) taught me as much as the successes. The decision to switch from Hugging Face to Groq taught me about adaptability. The time spent on UI taught me about user experience. The documentation taught me about communication.
I didn't just build a chatbot. I built a learning experience for myself and (hopefully) an impressive demonstration of what I can accomplish when given a challenge.
Thank you for this opportunity. It's been an incredible learning experience.
